I work as Associate Professor at the [Electrical Engineering Mathematics and Computer Science Faculty at the Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs). I also direct research at the [Delft AI Energy Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/delft-ai-energy-lab), work as a Principal Scientist at the [Austrian Institute of Technology in the Center for Energy](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/about-the-ait/center/center-for-energy) and co-direct (non-executive) the Canadian organisation [Student Energy](https://studentenergy.org/). My research develops fundamental methods based on AI and Machine learning that lead to new use cases in energy systems ranging from demand response to distributed real-time control over centralised coordinated operations in real-time. My team develops novel algorithms that can process substantial amounts of data and advance energy systems operations from societal, sustainable, and economic perspectives. Before, I worked on Machine Learning applications for power systems at Imperial College London, operationa research and control theory at Carnegie Mellon and MIT. During my studies, I worked in the chemical and energy industry, in China and Germany. I hold an M.Sc. in Chemical Engineering, a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, and a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany. I am active member of the IEEE PES Taskforces and CIGRE C2 working groups.
