title: "ROBUST Trustworthy AI-based Systems for Sustainable Growth ROBUST ICAI Project"
excerpt: "ROBUST ‘Trustworthy AI systems for sustainable growth’ is a Long Term Program (LTP) from NWO. The robust program aims to achieve breakthroughs in five core dimensions of robust artificial intelligence (AI): accuracy, reliability, repeatability, resilience, and security. The reliability of an AI-based system is formalized through so-called contracts, that is, explicit guarantees about the intended behavior of the system. Explanations can bring intrinsic confidence to general users. Therefore, the development of explanation and evaluation methods is an essential part of this research. <br/><img src='/images/ICAILab.png' style='width:50%;'>"

The AI for Energy Grids Lab extends the Innovation Center for AI and is part of the Long Term Program on Trustworthy Al-based Systems for Sustainable Growth. The Lab will develop algorithms for energy grids and focus on two main ways of extending grid capabilities, one focusing on improving grid operations and the other on targeted infrastructure expansions. In particular, the Lab will analyse large-scale, noisy grid data and develop reliable and safe AI-based methods that learn from this type of data to support the extension of grid capabilities. 

‍Distribution system operators such as Alliander are responsible for the maintenance and operation of the medium-low voltage grid, connecting end-users with generators to the transmission high-voltage grid. With the aim of augmenting the transport capability of this distribution grid, this laboratory seeks to address the distinct challenges encountered in the Netherlands and the thousands of distribution grids worldwide. Our lab focuses on two approaches to increasing the grid capability, one of which is to improve grid operations and the other to investigate targeted infrastructure expansions. In both of these, the analysis of grid data and the development of new methods and tools that utilize this data is the primary task. The first approach is to make more efficient use of the grid, utilizing technologies such as smart charging, batteries, flex markets, and DER control, as well as increasing insight into grid loads, such as cable temperatures, to allow for larger currents without increasing the probability of power failures and accelerated cable aging. These technologies can provide a more comprehensive understanding of grid currents and voltages to support operational decision-making, which promises a more efficient, sustainable, and reliable use of energy. The second approach is to accelerate the rate of grid expansion beyond that of the past. This can only be achieved by automating time-consuming and/or repetitive tasks and optimizing the work package in the most efficient way, due to the shortage of skilled mechanics and engineers.

Within the programme, the ICAI AI for Energy Grids Lab is a collaboration between Alliander, Delft University of Technology, HAN University of Applied Sciences, Radboud University, and University of Twente. From TU Delft, the researchers active in this programme are our PhD researchers Eva de Winkel, Shaohong Shi and Betül Mamudi, I am the principal investigator (TU Delft) and other investigators are Prof. Dr. Peter Palensky, Dr. Simon Tindemans and Dr. Roel Dobbe. The programme runs from 2022 to 2032. Please find more information [here](https://www.icai.ai/labs/ai-for-energy-grids-lab/)
