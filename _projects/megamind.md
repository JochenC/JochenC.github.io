title: "MEGAMIND Measuring, Gathering, Mining and Integrating Data for Self-management in the Edge of the Electricity System"
excerpt: "Network operators and market parties are looking for ways to prevent intelligently  overloading the network and to link supply and demand. The MEGAMIND programme brings together knowledge of energy systems, artificial intelligence and regulation to develop both the necessary technology and appropriate regulations. The researchers aim to develop models to predict when problems will arise. Then, they will have devices that consume energy interact directly with devices that produce energy to avoid these situations. <br/><img src='/images/megamind_logo.png' width="200">"

The MEGAMIND research Program comprises a significant step in the second digitization wave in the energy distribution grid by developing a new way in which value-chain partners in local electricity systems (the electricity grid edge) interact with each other and with value-chain actors in the higher-level electricity system. We envision a highly self-managed system that automatically and dynamically steers electrical energy flows taking into account the technical boundaries of the network and while the energy transition unfolds. The project is funded by the NWO perspective Program, 2021. From TU Delft, the researcher active in this project is our PhD researcher Demetris Chrysostmou and the principal investigator (TU Delft) is Dr. Jose Rueda.
