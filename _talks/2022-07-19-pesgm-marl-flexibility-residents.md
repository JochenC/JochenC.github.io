The IEEE PES General Meeting 2022 featured a session titled "Advanced Applications of Modern Optimization and Artificial Intelligence Methods on Active Distribution Networks." This session focused on cutting-edge optimization techniques and AI applications in planning and managing active distribution systems.

The panel discussion included my presentation "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Incentivized Flexibility from Residents," which explored how multi-agent reinforcement learning can enable effective incentivization of residential energy flexibility, contributing to improved efficiency and operational resilience in distribution networks.
