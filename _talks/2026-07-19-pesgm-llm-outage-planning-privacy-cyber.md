At the IEEE PES General Meeting 2026, I will speak on the integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into transmission outage planning workflows. Based on work on LLM-driven grid analysis and contract/chat systems, this talk will articulate both the opportunities and the **privacy and cybersecurity challenges** that emerge when bringing powerful language models into core operations. 

Key themes will include:
- how LLMs can be integrated with functional programs and grid simulation tools to automate aspects of planning and maintenance,
- potential attack surfaces introduced by LLM-based interfaces,
- risks of data leakage, prompt-based exploitation, and secure API design,
- governance and human oversight for safety-critical usage.

This talk grounds future directions in both **practical integration paths** and **necessary safeguards** for robust deployment.
