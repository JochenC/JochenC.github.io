At the AAPG Energy Transition Forum 2019, held on October 10 in Edinburgh, UK, a keynote address titled "A Student Perspective on Climate Change" was delivered. This address provided insights into the concerns and expectations of the younger generation regarding climate change, emphasizing the role of education and innovation in driving the energy transition. At AAPG Energy Transition Forum, I presented the vision of the [Climate Entrpreneurs Club](https://www.climateentrepreneurs.uk/), a club I was founding with friends in London, now a student run club at Imperial College London dediacted to take entrepreneurial initiatives that can positively impact the global society.
