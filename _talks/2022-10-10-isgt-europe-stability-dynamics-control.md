The IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe) 2022 conference, held from October 10â€“12 in Novi Sad, Serbia, featured a super session titled "Stability, Dynamics, and Control of Emerging Renewable-Rich Power Systems." 

This session addressed the challenges and solutions associated with the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the corresponding phase-out of synchronous generator units, fundamentally changing the dynamics and characteristics of power systems.
