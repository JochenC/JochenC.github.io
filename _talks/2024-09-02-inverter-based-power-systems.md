The "Inverter-Based Power Systems" summer school, held from September 2â€“6, 2024, at Imperial College London, provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges and emerging research directions in power systems dominated by inverter-based resources (IBRs). The program covered topics such as modeling and control of power converters, system stability analysis, novel protection solutions, and optimization tools for future power systems. My tutorial focused on innovative approaches to integrating renewable energy sources and enhancing the resilience and efficiency of modern power grids.
