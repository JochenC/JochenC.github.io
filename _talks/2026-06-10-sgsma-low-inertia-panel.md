At IEEE SGSMA 2026, I will participate as a panel speaker on *Application of Big Data & Analytics to maintain the secure operation of transmission systems — advances by the IEEE Working Group*.

My contribution will focus on **data-driven approaches for low-inertia power systems**, where high renewable penetration and inverter-based resources accelerate dynamics and challenge conventional stability margins. We will discuss:
- analytics frameworks that augment traditional stability assessment with **real-time indicators**,
- hybrid physics + data methods that combine domain knowledge and machine learning,
- and workflows that translate predictive insights into secure operational choices.

The panel will also cover:
- the mission and recent work of the IEEE Working Group,
- key methods and benchmarks from Technical Reports TR100 and TR104,
- real-time lab demonstrations and open-access datasets via the SANDI initiative.
