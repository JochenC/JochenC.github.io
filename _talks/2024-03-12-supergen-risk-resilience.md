The EPSRC Supergen Energy Networks Hub Risk and Resilience Day is an annual seminar that continues the tradition of the previous Durham Risk Day series (2010-2014). It brings together researchers involved in all aspects of risk and uncertainty analysis applied to current and future power and energy systems. 

My presentation, titled "Constraint-Driven Deep Learning for N-k Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow," focused on integrating deep learning techniques with optimization methods to enhance the security and efficiency of power system operations.
