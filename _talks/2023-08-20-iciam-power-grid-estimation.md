The 10th International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2023) was held from August 20â€“25, 2023, at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. This congress brought together applied mathematicians, researchers, and practitioners from around the world to discuss advancements and applications in various fields of mathematics. 

In the session titled "Physics-Based and Data-Driven Modelling for Digital Twin," our presentation on "Weakly Supervised Learning for Power Grid State Estimation" explored innovative approaches to enhance the accuracy of state estimation in power grids. Our talk focused on combining physics-based models with data-driven techniques, particularly weakly supervised learning, to develop robust digital twins for power systems.
