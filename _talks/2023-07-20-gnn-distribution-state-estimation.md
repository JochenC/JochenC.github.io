During the IEEE PES General Meeting 2023, a panel session titled "Machine Learning and Modern Heuristic Optimization for Planning and Operation of Active Distribution Networks" was conducted. This session delved into advanced machine learning techniques and heuristic optimization methods to enhance the planning and operation of active distribution networks.

In the panel, my focus was on "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Distribution State Estimation," discussing how GNNs can model and analyze the complex relationships within power distribution systems to improve state estimation accuracy and operational efficiency.
