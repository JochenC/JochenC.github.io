Electricity price forecasting is rapidly evolving, yet strong performance in one market or context does not automatically transfer to others. In this talk, I will present insights into **what aspects of price models actually generalize**, covering both intraday dynamics and continental-scale dependencies.

I will highlight how **rich feature representations** and market liquidity influence transferability across markets. Building on recent work with foundation models for probabilistic electricity forecasting, we will also examine how **explicit modeling of spatial interdependencies** across multiple regions (such as European markets) can improve probabilistic forecasting performance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

The talk will argue that generalization must be **designed**, not assumed — guided by market structure, data characteristics, spatial scale, and uncertainty quantification.
