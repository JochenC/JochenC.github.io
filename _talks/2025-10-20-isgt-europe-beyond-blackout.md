At the IEEE ISGT Europe 2025 conference in Malta, the special panel *“Beyond the Blackout: Building Resilient Grids for an Interconnected Europe”* will address one of the most pressing challenges for Europe’s energy transition: how to safeguard electricity supply against large-scale failures. Motivated by the recent Iberian blackout, the session will explore how extreme weather, cyber threats, renewable integration, and cross-border interdependencies may combine into cascading disruptions with severe societal and economic consequences.  

The session will be chaired by **Jochen Cremer (TU Delft)** and bring together distinguished experts from across Europe:
- **Lina Bertling Tjernberg (KTH, Sweden)** – reliability and asset management in power systems,  
- **Luis Badesa (UPM, Spain)** – economics and operation of grids under decarbonisation,  
- **Mathaios Panteli (University of Cyprus)** – resilience analysis and cascading failure modelling,  
- **Mónica Aragüés Peñalba (UPC, Spain)** – data-driven analytics for resilient grids.  

The panel will discuss:  
- Vulnerabilities exposed by the Iberian blackout and lessons for interconnected grids,  
- The use of **probabilistic risk assessment, resilience metrics, and stochastic planning** for future grid design,  
- The role of **digitalisation, forecasting, automation, and AI-driven protection systems** to prevent cascading failures,  
- How **TSOs and DSOs** can improve coordination in crisis situations,  
- The evolution of **policy and regulation** to enable flexibility, cooperation, and rapid response.  

The discussion will also connect to ongoing European research projects, such as **SPARROW, R²D², ATTEST, SmartNet, and HVDC-WISE**, which develop digital twins, resilience toolkits, TSO–DSO coordination schemes, and HVDC-based architectures for robust hybrid grids.  

By convening this panel, ISGT Europe 2025 will provide a platform to outline strategies for **resilient, adaptive, and cooperative power systems**. The expected outcome is to strengthen the ability to anticipate and manage extreme events while ensuring electricity for critical services—key to protecting societies and economies in an interconnected Europe.
