During the IEEE SGSMA 2022 conference, a panel session titled "PMU- and AI-Based Analysis for a Resilient Operation of Future Power Systems" was held. This session delved into the utilization of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and artificial intelligence to enhance the resilience and reliability of future power systems.

My presentation "AI Methods For Realtime Dynamic Security Assessment" discussed advanced AI techniques applied to Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA), highlighting how these methods can predict and mitigate potential system instabilities.
