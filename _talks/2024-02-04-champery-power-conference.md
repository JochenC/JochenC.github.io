The 3rd Champéry Power Conference, held from February 4–9, 2024, was organized by the Institute of Sustainable Energy at the School of Engineering of Valais and the Automatic Control Laboratory of the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich. The conference gathered international experts in the field of electric power systems to identify current and future challenges, as well as opportunities facing electric power systems in the context of the energy transition. 

My talk, titled "Weakly-supervised Graph Neural Networks for Distribution System State Estimation," explored innovative approaches using graph neural networks to improve the accuracy of state estimation in distribution systems, contributing to enhanced energy system optimization and sustainability.
