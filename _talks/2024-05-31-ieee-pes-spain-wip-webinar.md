This webinar, organized by the IEEE PES Spain Chapter's Women in Power initiative, focused on artificial intelligence applications in energy systems. Researchers from CITCEA-UPC and TU Delft presented recent developments, including new computational methods for system operation and control that combine statistical machine learning and mathematical optimization.

My talk contributed to discussions on AI-driven solutions for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of power and energy systems.
