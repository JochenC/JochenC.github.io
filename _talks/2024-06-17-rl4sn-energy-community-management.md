The Workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic Networks (RL4SN), held from June 17â€“21, 2024, at ENSEEIHT in Toulouse, France, focused on the development of learning algorithms suitable for situations where data is scarce or computational power is limited, with a particular emphasis on stochastic networks. 

My talk, titled "Reinforcement Learning for Energy Community Management," explored how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to optimize the management of energy communities, enhancing efficiency and sustainability in energy distribution and consumption.
