description: |
  The paper introduces a **soft bus-bar splitting** strategy at converter substations—paired with corrective network topology reconfiguration (NTR)—to boost operational flexibility in hybrid AC/DC systems. This method strikes a balance between flexibility and grid security under N-1 contingency constraints. Highlights include:
  
  - Integration of **VSC set-point control** (pre- and post-contingency) with topology reconfiguration.
  - Use of a **column-and-constraint generation algorithm** to solve the NP-hard problem.
  - Case studies on IEEE 5, 24, 39, and 67 hybrid AC/DC test systems show significant reductions in operating cost, improved security, and lowered converter redispatch needs across various load scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
