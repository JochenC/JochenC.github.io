permalink: /publication/2025-08-01-corrective-substation-reconfiguration
excerpt: "This paper explores corrective soft bus-bar splitting in converter substations with modular architectures to enhance flexibility in hybrid AC/DC grids. Using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm, the proposed approach optimizes topology under N-1 constraints, demonstrating improved security and reduced redispatch costs."
