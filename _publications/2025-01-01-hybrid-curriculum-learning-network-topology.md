permalink: /publication/2025-01-01-hybrid-curriculum-learning-network-topology
excerpt: "This paper presents a hybrid approach combining curriculum-trained reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for network topology control. The proposed method enhances training stability, improves sample efficiency, and mitigates unforeseen RL actions, offering a novel solution for grid congestion management."
