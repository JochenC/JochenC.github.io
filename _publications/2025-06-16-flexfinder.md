excerpt: "The Netherlands' transition to renewable energy is straining the power grid, necessitating innovative solutions to mitigate congestion while awaiting grid extension. Non-firm Connection Transmission Agreements (CTAs), or flexibility contracts, offer a promising solution by enabling variable or on-demand capacity limits. However, determining suitable contracts for customers and ensuring grid compatibility is complex, requiring expert involvement and hindering large-scale implementation. To address this, we propose FlexFinder, a multi-agent system utilising Large Language Models to simplify contract identification and negotiation. FlexFinder interacts with customers, infers their needs, and suggests tailored contracts. It evaluates grid feasibility using power system tools, automating a traditionally expert-intensive process. Simulations across 17 customer roles demonstrated FlexFinder’s effectiveness, with GPT-4.0 achieving an accuracy of 83.3% compared to 65.5% for GPT-3.5. Bayesian analysis confirmed the system’s robustness across variations in verbosity and spelling errors. FlexFinder facilitates efficient, scalable negotiations, ensuring optimal grid utilisation and accelerating renewable energy adoption."
