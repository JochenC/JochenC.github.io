excerpt: "We propose FlexFinder, a multi-agent system utilising Large Language Models to simplify contract identification and negotiation. FlexFinder interacts with customers, infers their needs, and suggests tailored contracts. It evaluates grid feasibility using power system tools, automating a traditionally expert-intensive process. Simulations across 17 customer roles demonstrated FlexFinder’s effectiveness, with GPT-4.0 achieving an accuracy of 83.3% compared to 65.5% for GPT-3.5. Bayesian analysis confirmed the system’s robustness across variations in verbosity and spelling errors."
