excerpt: "Presently, transmission system operators are tackling challenging dynamic issues in scenarios close to real-time utilizing their dynamic stability assessment tools and data acquisition devices that have in operation. These devices use different types of technology and the majority of the tools used in the control centers are tailored to each of them. Most challenges affecting the security of these systems are associated with current paradigms of management and planning such as the inclusion of deregulated markets, the interconnection with neighboring regional systems, the diversification of energy sources, and the involvement of environmental constraints. Under these conditions, the security and reliability of the transmission system can be compromised with unexpected disturbances causing violations of the security limits established and subsequently leading to the system collapse. To contribute to the finding of solutions to these problems, the members of this IEEE Task Force have worked together to gather information from eleven utilities in nine different countries in America and Europe. The main objective is to establish a baseline of these common concerns, which can be used to develop, in the next step, solutions based on machine learning and data-driven innovative algorithms."
