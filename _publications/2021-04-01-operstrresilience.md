excerpt: "CIGRE C2.25 Working Groupâ€™s focus has been on operating strategies and preparedness for system operational resilience. The role of system operation is classified into power system resilience. For this objective, the WG prepared two surveys and assessed the responses of the respondents to the difference in understanding of resilience and reliability, the degree to which relevant HILF events have happened in different parts of the world and the operational resilience strategies that have been used to measure and manage these situations. Furthermore, improvements in the operational resilience have been the subject of questions in the surveys."
