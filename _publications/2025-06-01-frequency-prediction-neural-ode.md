excerpt: "This paper presents a novel application of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to predict power system frequency dynamics. The approach offers a data-driven solution for real-time frequency monitoring and control. More information about this project can be found [here](https://mert-node.vercel.app/) "
