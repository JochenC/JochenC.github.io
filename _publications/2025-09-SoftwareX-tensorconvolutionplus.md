description: |
  Power system operators need effective tools to harness flexibility from distributed resources under uncertainty. TensorConvolutionPlus fills this gap by providing a user-friendly and open-source Python package for estimating flexibility areas in distribution systems. Key features include:
  
  - The **TensorConvolution+ algorithm**, a power flow-based method, exhaustive PF-based algorithm, and optimal power flow-based algorithm.
  - Flexibility adaptation across different operating conditions.
  - Support for flexibility service providers offering discrete setpoints.
  - Encourages broader adoption by system operators and researchers. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
