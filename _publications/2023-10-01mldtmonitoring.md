excerpt: "Monitoring and Control of Electrical Power Systems using Machine Learning Techniques bridges the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and their application in the control and monitoring of electrical power systems, particularly relevant for heavily distributed energy systems and real-time application. The book reviews key applications of deep learning, spatio-temporal, and advanced signal processing methods for monitoring power quality. This reference introduces guiding principles for the monitoring and control of power quality disturbances arising from integration of power electronic devices and discusses monitoring and control of electrical power systems using benchmark test systems for the creation of bespoke advanced data analytic algorithms."
